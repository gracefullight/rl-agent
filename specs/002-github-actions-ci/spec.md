# Feature Specification: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline for Next.js Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `002-github-actions-ci`  
**Created**: September 13, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for building and deploying Next.js app to gh-pages on main branch push"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: automated deployment, Next.js build, gh-pages target
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, GitHub Actions
   ‚Üí Actions: push to main, build Next.js app, deploy to gh-pages
   ‚Üí Data: source code, built assets, deployment artifacts
   ‚Üí Constraints: main branch trigger only
3. No unclear aspects identified - deployment flow is standard
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: push ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable through CI/CD execution
6. No data entities involved (infrastructure automation)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ‚Üí Implementation details avoided (focus on behavior)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the RL Agent project, I want to automatically deploy the latest version of the application to a publicly accessible website whenever I push changes to the main branch, so that stakeholders can always view the current state of the application without manual deployment steps.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has made changes to the application, **When** they push commits to the main branch, **Then** the system automatically builds and deploys the updated application to the live website
2. **Given** the build process completes successfully, **When** the deployment finishes, **Then** the live website reflects the latest changes within a reasonable timeframe
3. **Given** a build fails due to compilation errors, **When** the failure occurs, **Then** the deployment does not proceed and the previous working version remains live

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the build process fails midway through deployment?
- How does the system handle concurrent pushes to main branch?
- What occurs if the gh-pages deployment target becomes unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically trigger a build and deployment process when new commits are pushed to the main branch
- **FR-002**: System MUST build the Next.js application into static assets suitable for hosting
- **FR-003**: System MUST deploy the built application to GitHub Pages (gh-pages branch)
- **FR-004**: System MUST only deploy when the build process completes successfully without errors
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain the previous deployment if the current build fails
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear feedback about build and deployment status to developers
- **FR-007**: System MUST make the deployed application accessible via a public GitHub Pages URL
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the application's functionality when deployed as static assets
- **FR-009**: System MUST complete the entire build and deployment process within a reasonable timeframe (under 10 minutes)
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle static asset paths correctly for GitHub Pages subdirectory hosting
