# Phase 0: Research & Technology Decisions

**Feature**: Grid World Value Iteration Simulator  
**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Findings

### Canvas Rendering Library

**Decision**: React Konva (`react-konva`)

**Rationale**: 
- Native React integration with declarative component syntax
- High performance 2D canvas rendering optimized for interactions
- Built-in event handling for clicks, drags, and hover states
- Excellent support for animations and transitions
- Strong Next.js compatibility with proper SSR handling patterns
- Extensive documentation and examples for grid-based visualizations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- HTML5 Canvas (direct): Lower-level, requires manual event handling
- Fabric.js: More complex for simple grid requirements
- SVG-based solutions: Performance concerns for real-time updates

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use Next.js dynamic imports with `ssr: false` to prevent server-side issues
- Configure webpack externals for canvas module compatibility
- Layer-based architecture for grid, agent, and UI overlays

### State Management

**Decision**: Jotai (`jotai`)

**Rationale**:
- Atomic state management perfect for granular grid cell updates
- Eliminates React Context "provider hell" common in complex state scenarios
- Bottom-up approach allows independent atom updates without re-rendering entire grid
- Excellent performance for frequent value iteration updates
- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux or Zustand
- Provider-less mode simplifies setup for single-page applications

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React Context: Would cause excessive re-renders with frequent updates
- Zustand: Good but lacks atomic granularity needed for grid cells
- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for local state management

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create separate atoms for grid state, agent position, utility values, and simulation config
- Use derived atoms for computed values like optimal policy
- Implement persistence atoms for save/load functionality if needed

### Utility Functions

**Decision**: es-toolkit (`es-toolkit`)

**Rationale**:
- Modern replacement for Lodash with 2-3x better performance
- 97% smaller bundle size critical for web applications
- TypeScript-first design with excellent type safety
- Perfect for array/object manipulation needed in value iteration algorithms
- Comprehensive utility functions for grid operations and data transformations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Lodash: Larger bundle size, older architecture
- Ramda: Functional programming approach may be overkill
- Native JS methods: Missing advanced utilities needed for complex operations

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use for grid matrix operations, array transformations, and object manipulations
- Leverage `flattenObject` for complex state serialization
- Utilize array utilities for policy calculations and value updates

### UI Framework

**Decision**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS

**Rationale**:
- Component-based architecture perfect for modular interface design
- Copy-paste approach allows customization for specific visualization needs
- Excellent accessibility support crucial for educational tools
- Seamless Tailwind integration for responsive design
- Active community and comprehensive component library

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Material-UI: Heavier bundle, less customization flexibility
- Chakra UI: Good but less momentum and ecosystem support
- Ant Design: Complex setup, design not aligned with modern web standards

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use Button, Input, Card, and Table components for controls and displays
- Implement custom grid visualization components
- Leverage Tailwind for responsive layout and mathematical notation display

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Playwright for E2E Testing

**Rationale**:
- Excellent canvas interaction testing capabilities
- Cross-browser compatibility essential for educational tools
- Built-in screenshot comparison for visual regression testing
- Robust handling of async operations needed for value iteration
- Strong ecosystem integration with CI/CD pipelines

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Cypress: Less robust canvas testing support
- Selenium: More complex setup and maintenance
- Viest + React Testing Library: Good for unit tests but insufficient for canvas interactions

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create test scenarios for each acceptance criteria
- Use visual regression testing for utility value displays
- Implement performance testing for iteration speed
- Test accessibility compliance for educational use

### Development Tools

**Decision**: 
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (faster installs, efficient disk usage)
- **Linting**: biome v2 (faster than ESLint, TypeScript-first)
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (structured changelog generation)

**Rationale**:
- pnpm provides faster installs and better dependency management
- biome v2 offers significant performance improvements over ESLint/Prettier
- Conventional commits enable automated changelog and versioning

## Architecture Patterns

### Grid State Management
- Atomic state for each grid cell enables independent updates
- Derived atoms for computed values (policy, convergence status)
- Immutable update patterns for mathematical correctness

### Canvas Rendering
- Layer-based architecture: Background grid, agent overlay, interaction layer
- Component composition for reusable grid elements
- Event delegation for efficient click/hover handling

### Algorithm Implementation
- Pure function approach for value iteration calculations
- Web Workers consideration for heavy computations (future enhancement)
- Configurable parameters for different MDP scenarios

### Performance Optimization
- Memoization of expensive calculations using React.memo
- Efficient re-rendering through atomic state updates
- Canvas optimization for smooth animations

## Integration Considerations

### Next.js 15 Compatibility
- App router structure for modern routing
- Server component optimization where applicable
- Client-side hydration handling for canvas elements

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation for grid interactions
- Screen reader support for utility values
- High contrast mode compatibility

### Educational Features
- Step-by-step visualization capabilities
- Exportable state for classroom sharing
- Configurable algorithm parameters for learning

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- 60fps canvas rendering during animations
- <100ms response time for iteration calculations
- <2MB initial bundle size

### User Experience Goals
- Intuitive grid interaction patterns
- Clear visual feedback for all operations
