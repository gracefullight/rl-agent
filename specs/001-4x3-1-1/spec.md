# Feature Specification: Grid World Value Iteration Simulator

**Feature Branch**: `001-4x3-1-1`  
**Created**: September 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "4x3 공간에 1,1에서 출발하고, 2,2에는 못가는 벽이있고, 4,2는 -1, 4,3은 +1의 Terminal 인 상태에 위로는 0.8 좌로는 0.1 우로는 0.1의 확률을 가진 에이전트가 움직일 수 있는 웹 캔버스 게임을 만들고 싶어. iterate 버튼을 누르면 확률에 따라 움직이고, reset 을 누르면 초기위치로 돌아올거야. 사진에 보이는거처럼 iteration 마다 utility 값을 보여주는 영역과 solution 을 보여주는 영역은 캔버스 바깥에 있으면 좋겠어. 리워드는 -0.04 가 기본인데, 이 값은 인풋으로 받을 수 있으면 좋겠어. 사이클도 사진처럼 표현이 되면 좋겠어."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature description provided: Reinforcement learning grid world simulator
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identified: grid environment, agent movement, value iteration, visual feedback
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: configure grid, run simulation, observe results
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (grid, agent, simulation state)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All sections completed and requirements defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a student or researcher studying reinforcement learning, I want to visualize and interact with a value iteration algorithm in a grid world environment so that I can understand how agents learn optimal policies through iterative value updates and probabilistic movement.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application loads, **When** I view the interface, **Then** I see a 4x3 grid with the agent at position (1,1), a wall at (2,2), and terminal states clearly marked
2. **Given** the simulation is ready, **When** I click the "Iterate" button, **Then** the agent moves according to the specified probabilities (80% intended direction, 10% left, 10% right) and utility values update
3. **Given** the agent has moved from its starting position, **When** I click the "Reset" button, **Then** the agent returns to position (1,1) and all values reset to initial state
4. **Given** I want to experiment with different reward values, **When** I change the reward input field, **Then** the simulation uses the new reward value for subsequent iterations
5. **Given** the simulation is running, **When** each iteration completes, **Then** I can see the current utility values for each grid cell and the optimal policy (action directions) displayed outside the grid canvas

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the agent reaches a terminal state (rewards +1 or -1)?
- How does the system handle invalid reward input values?
- What occurs if the agent attempts to move into a wall or boundary?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a 4x3 grid world with clearly distinguishable cells
- **FR-002**: System MUST position the agent at starting location (1,1) upon initialization and reset
- **FR-003**: System MUST render a wall obstacle at position (2,2) that blocks agent movement
- **FR-004**: System MUST mark terminal states at positions (4,2) with reward -1 and (4,3) with reward +1
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement probabilistic movement where intended direction has 80% probability, left turn has 10% probability, and right turn has 10% probability
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide an "Iterate" button that triggers one step of value iteration algorithm
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a "Reset" button that returns the simulation to initial state
- **FR-008**: System MUST display current utility values for each grid cell outside the canvas area
- **FR-009**: System MUST show the optimal policy (directional arrows) for each non-terminal state outside the canvas area
- **FR-010**: System MUST accept user input for step reward value with default value of -0.04
- **FR-011**: System MUST display current iteration/cycle count
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent agent movement into walls and grid boundaries
- **FR-013**: System MUST terminate episodes when agent reaches terminal states
- **FR-014**: System MUST update utility values using the value iteration algorithm after each iteration
- **FR-015**: System MUST visually distinguish between different cell types (normal, wall, terminal positive, terminal negative, agent position)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Grid World**: 4x3 matrix representing the environment with cell types (normal, wall, terminal)
- **Agent**: Entity that moves through the grid with current position and movement probabilities
- **Utility Values**: Numerical values representing the expected cumulative reward for each grid cell
- **Policy**: Optimal action (direction) for each non-terminal grid cell
- **Simulation State**: Current iteration count, agent position, and algorithm convergence status
- **Reward Configuration**: Step reward value and terminal state rewards
