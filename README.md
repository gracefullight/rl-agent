## üìö Educational Use

This simulator is designed for:
- Computer Science courses on Artificial Intelligence
- Reinforcement Learning workshops and tutorials
- Interactive demonstrations of MDP concepts
- Visual understanding of value iteration convergence

## üîß Configuration

The grid world environment includes:
- **Grid Size**: 4x3 with 1-based indexing
- **Start Position**: (1,1)
- **Wall**: (2,2) - impassable state
- **Terminal States**: 
  - (4,2) = -1 reward (negative terminal)
  - (4,3) = +1 reward (positive terminal)
- **Step Reward**: -0.04 (configurable)
- **Discount Factor**: 1.0 (configurable)

## üöÄ Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

1. **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
2. **Build**: Next.js static export with optimization
3. **Test**: Unit tests and E2E tests must pass
4. **Deploy**: Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages

## üìñ Algorithm Details

### Value Iteration

Implements the Bellman equation:
```
V(s) = R(s) + Œ≥ * max_a Œ£ P(s'|s,a) * V(s')
```

Where:
- `V(s)` = Value of state s
- `R(s)` = Reward for state s
- `Œ≥` = Discount factor
- `P(s'|s,a)` = Transition probability from state s to s' given action a

### Movement Model

- **Intended Action**: 80% probability
- **Perpendicular Actions**: 10% each (left/right turn)
- **Boundary Handling**: Stay in place if action would lead out of bounds
- **Wall Collision**: Remain in current state
